## Description
 This application is designed to make creating SVG logos quick and simple. There are three options for shapes for your logo: squares, triangles, and circles. The colors and the text are decided by the user from a series of prompts. The generated SVG file will be added into the example folder of the repository for your use.

## Usage
 Start the program with the command node index.js. Answer all the prompts. Find your generated logo in the example folder. 


## Installation
 This app requires Inquirer and Jest. Run npm install in the terminal before use to install the necessary modules.


## Tests
 Tests are performed using Jest. Run npm jest in the terminal to perform tests. The tests check to ensure that the render methods in each shape class are returning proper strings for an SVG shape.
